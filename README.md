# Social-Network-API-Challenge-18

## Description

This is the eighteenth challenge in the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp (Module 18). This is the backend-only functionality for a generic social network, which allows users to create an account, a thought, a friend's list, and a reaction to a thought, as well as update, view, and delete any of the above. This challenge is utilizing a noSQL database, and we are using MongoDB and Mongoose as our database and and ODM library, respectively, to perform each action in the CRUD method.
